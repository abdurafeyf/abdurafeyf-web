# Abstract

Automated chest X-ray report generation has emerged as a critical application for improving clinical efficiency and reducing physician workload. This paper presents Radixpert, a novel vision-language model that leverages a large-scale Spanish-language dataset and hierarchical cross-modal fusion for enhanced report generation. Our approach utilizes the Llama 3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model as the foundation, enhanced with a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methodology and a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Fusion architecture. We trained our model on a 16,000-sample subset of the PadChest dataset, training it to generate reports directly in Spanish. Radixpert demonstrates strong performance on this task, showing a practical path for developing specialized, single-language medical VLMs. Code is publicly available on [https://github.com/abdurafeyf/RadixpertV2](https://github.com/abdurafeyf/RadixpertV2)
