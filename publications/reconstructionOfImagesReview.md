# Abstract

The reconstruction of visual stimuli from human brain activity represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience, offering a window into the internal representations of the mind. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the field, beginning with the biological underpinnings of the visual cortex and the signal characteristics of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We mathematically formulate the reconstruction task as an ill-posed inverse problem, where the objective is to recover high-dimensional visual information from sparse, noisy hemodynamic signals. The review traces the methodological evolution of the field, from early linear decoders and hand-crafted feature bases to the current paradigm shift driven by Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and generative artificial intelligence. Special attention is given to state-of-the-art approaches utilizing Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which have achieved unprecedented photorealism by effectively leveraging strong semantic priors. Finally, we critically examine the limitations of current techniques – including cross-subject generalization, temporal resolution, and generative hallucinations – and discuss the benchmark datasets that are shaping the future of neural decoding.
