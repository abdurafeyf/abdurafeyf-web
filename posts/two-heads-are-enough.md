# Abstract
This presentation reviews DualU-Net, an efficient deep learning architecture for nuclei segmentation in histopathology images that reduces computational complexity by eliminating decoder redundancy. Unlike HoVer-Net's three-decoder approach, DualU-Net uses only two heads—segmentation and detection—achieving a 33% reduction in decoder-side computation from O(L × N × k² × C × 3) to O(L × N × k² × C × 2). Empirical validation demonstrates 5× faster inference than HoVer-Net while maintaining segmentation accuracy, proving that architectural simplification through redundancy elimination can significantly improve algorithmic efficiency in medical image analysis applications.
