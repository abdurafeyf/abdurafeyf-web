Hi there, I'm Abdul Rafey, a senior undergraduate student at [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk), majoring in Software Engineering. My research interests lie at the intersection of multi-modal representation learning and inverse problems in biomedical imaging.

My thesis focused on the interpretability of medical scans to generate coherent radiology reports, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Hashir M. Kiani](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/hashir-moheed-kiani/). I was also part of the [Machine Vision & Intelligent Systems Lab (MachVis)](https://vision.seecs.edu.pk/) with [Dr. Nazia Perwaiz](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/nazia-perwaiz/), where our study focused on generating pathology reports from gigapixel histopathological images *while ensuring generalizability across diverse ethnic and regional data sources*.

Previously, I was a [Mitacs](https://globalink.mitacs.ca/) intern at the University of Saskatchewan with [Dr. Zadia Codabux](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/zadiacodabux/research.html), where I studied the impact of Technical Debt (TD) on open-source software using NLP techniques.

I also spent an exchange semester at [Utah Tech University](https://utahtech.edu/), where most of my time was spent studying courses like Distributed Computing, Machine Learning, and American Governmen or playing piano & pickleball. St. George, Utah, will always remain close to my heart. I was honored to serve the community during my stay. I volunteered at the [Dove Center](https://dovecenter.org/), a shelter for domestic abuse survivors. We also organized Chinese New Year at the [Atwood Innovation Plaza](https://innovation.utahtech.edu/) and had the opportunity to simulate an accident with medical students at [Intermountain Health St. George Regional Hospital](https://intermountainhealthcare.org/locations/st-george-regional-hospital).

Feel free to reach out to me at [mfarooqi.bese21seecs@seecs.edu.pk](mailto:mfarooqi.bese21seecs@seecs.edu.pk) — I'd love to talk about anything.
