Hello there! I am completing my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering at [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk) under the tutelage of [Dr. Hashir M. Kiani](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/hashir-moheed-kiani/) and [Dr. Nazia Perwaiz](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/nazia-perwaiz/). My research interests, which occasionaly fascinates me as well, include Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Biomedical Imaging. My goal, though quite broad, is to cover multi-dimensionality of medical images from under-resouced areas and use them to build NLG models that are generalizable for a wide population.

I had a chance to work with [Dr. Zadia Codabux](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/zadiacodabux/research.html) at the SEARCH Lab, [University of Saskatchewan](https://usask.ca/) under the umbrella of Empirical Software Engineering where my research was to understand the causes of technical debt in open-source softwares (such as those hosted on GitHub) and using Large Language Models to help reduce the technical debt in those softwares.
In Summer 2024, I worked as a Research Assistant at the SEARCH Lab, [University of Saskatchewan](https://usask.ca/), under the supervision of [Dr. Zadia Codabux](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/zadiacodabux/research.html), conducting research on ‘Reducing Technical Debt by Streamlining Issue Assignment on GitHub’ under the AI4SE umbrella.

During my junior year, I spent a semester at [Utah Tech University](https://utahtech.edu/) funded by the U.S. Department of State in partnership with [IREX](https://www.irex.org/).
