Hi, I'm Abdul Rafey, an undergraduate at [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk) studying Software Engineering. I worked on my thesis titled ['Radixpert'](https://assets.tina.io/1fb09d03-9237-4c49-aaa9-d024a83c7ac7/Radixpert__A_Staged_Adaptation_and_Hierarchical_Fusion_Framework_for_Radiology_VLMs.pdf) with [Dr. Hashir M. Kiani](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/hashir-moheed-kiani/). Outside of this, I spend time in the [Machine Vision & Intelligent Systems Lab](https://vision.seecs.edu.pk/), studying the intersection of medical imaging, computer vision, and natural language. My recent research is on extracting informative features from histopathological WSI images, produce clinically aligned reports, and *ensures generalizability across diverse ethnic and regional data sources*.

I have also studied the impacts of technical debt (TD) in open-source software (domain: Empirical Software Engineering) with [Dr. Zadia Codabux](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/zadiacodabux/research.html) at the Software Analytics Research (SEARch) Group, University of Saskatchewan, and how generative methods can help us remove TD.

At [Utah Tech](https://utahtech.edu/), I spent time studying Distributed Computing, Machine Learning, and American Government. On campus, I learned to play the piano and pickleball, and volunteered at the [Dove Center](https://dovecenter.org/) for domestic violence victims.

Feel free to reach out to me at [mfarooqi.bese21seecs@seecs.edu.pk](mailto:mfarooqi.bese21seecs@seecs.edu.pk) â€” I'd love to talk about anything.
