Hi there, I'm Abdul Rafey, a senior undergraduate student at [National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)](https://nust.edu.pk), majoring in Software Engineering. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational imaging, inverse problems, and neuroscience.

My thesis focused on the interpretability of medical scans to generate coherent radiology reports, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Hashir M. Kiani](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/hashir-moheed-kiani/). I was also part of the [Machine Vision & Intelligent Systems Lab (MachVis)](https://vision.seecs.edu.pk/) with [Dr. Nazia Perwaiz](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/nazia-perwaiz/), where our study focused on generating pathology reports from gigapixel histopathological images *while ensuring generalizability across diverse ethnic and regional data sources*. [MICCAI '25](https://reg2025.grand-challenge.org/reg2025/)

Previously, I was a [Mitacs](https://globalink.mitacs.ca/) intern at the University of Saskatchewan with [Dr. Zadia Codabux](https://www.cs.usask.ca/faculty/zadiacodabux/research.html), where I studied the impact of Technical Debt (TD) on open-source software using NLP techniques.

I also spent an exchange semester at [Utah Tech University](https://utahtech.edu/). Most of my time there was spent studying Distributed Computing, Machine Learning, and American Government. Outside of academics, I learned how to play the piano and pickleball, and also volunteered at regional and university-level institutions such as the Dove Center, Atwood Innovation Plaza, the 8th International Symposium (Activity), and Intermountain Health St. George Regional Hospital.

Feel free to reach out to me at [mfarooqi.bese21seecs@seecs.edu.pk](mailto:mfarooqi.bese21seecs@seecs.edu.pk) — I'd love to talk about anything.
